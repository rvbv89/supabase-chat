# About this app
This app was my first attempt at doing something other than a simple Express/Node server for the back end. I used Supabase on another small project, and I absolutely love everything about it. The dashboard, built in database queries, auth patterns etc. are all so simple to plug and play.  This project was previously built with Socket.io, but I really wanted to try out Supabase's real-time subscription features. So far so good!  I am currently building out a fuller-featured social media app that will incorporate this project.  It will feature a feed of user posts, an ability to connect with other users socially, and it will have different "boards" or "rooms" to post in. I'm still ironing some things out with the authorization flow in this app, and the next set of features will be registration/login support for Google, SMS etc. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
